/*
2 problems with this:
- if there is no data when the page is opened the form is immediately invalid
- both the form and the input field are red (only input field should be red)
*/
/*.ng-invalid {*/
/*  border: 1px solid red;*/
/*}*/

/* Select all elements with both classes ng-touched and ng-invalid.*/
/*.ng-invalid.ng-touched {*/
/*  border: 1px solid red;*/
/*}*/

/* Select all elements with the class name ng-touched
that are descendants of the element ng-invalid. (this works fine) */
/*.ng-invalid .ng-touched {*/
/*  border: 1px solid red;*/
/*}*/

/* Another way to solve this */
.ng-invalid:not(form).ng-touched {
  border: 1px solid red;
}
